# Minimal Portfolio Website

#### Another react test project, this time it's another portfolio website, but with a minimalist approach and a single page layout

## TO DO

###### Components

- [ ] Top Component: initial landing page
- [ ] Bottom Component: portfolio links and footer (Footer should contain a link to download CV)
- [ ] Link Component Basics: link text, link description, link to code, link to live app
- [ ] Link Component Advanced: Populate from JSON file,

###### Style

- [ ] Top Component shouldn't scroll but must show a bit of the Bottom Component (90% vH)
- [ ] Bottom Component will have inverted colors from Top Component to show links to projects and stuff
- [ ] Link text displays link description onClick (maybe sprites of tools used in project)

###### Other

- [x] Create Projects data file
- [ ] Change bottom half background and top half h2 text color to cycle between shades of gray and white
- [ ] subtle hover effects on hover for the links
